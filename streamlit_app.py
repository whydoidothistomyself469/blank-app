These skills are crucial in Electronics and Computer Engineering, where solving problems, whether it’s debugging a program or troubleshooting circuits, is common.")
        st.write("The first instance where my interest in Electronics sparked was in Secondary School. When I first took electronics as a subject, I expected it to be similiar to D&T but I was very wrong. I enjoyed learning about how each little component in a cirucit works to create something bigger to solve a specific issue or measurement of analytics. My interest in Electronics helped the information I learnt to be retained which is reflected in my academic results for the subject. It also gave me opportunities to enter competitions such as the TP Engineering Olympiad.")
        st.write("When I was young, I was always curious of how computer systems and code worked. Being an avid gamer was a catalyst that helped my interest in programming grow which lead me to join the Robotics Club in Secondary 1. Only having a phone at the time limited my ability to learn coding languages such as python as I was only able to understand it in theory. This caused me to slow down on learning how to code, but it improved my coding skills in robotics.")

I knew already that I wanted to be apart of it in some way. A course such as this, where I combined both my biggest interests into one, is perfect for me.")
